## What is Data Science?

Short answer, if we have to break it down to one sentence: **Data Science â‰ˆ "Gaining and communicating insights from complex data through digital techniques"**.

Unlike mathematics, physics, or history, data science has just begun to become a discipline of its own. If you ask 10 practicing data scientists what data science is, you might get very different answers. Worse still, there's not even a consensus on whether data science is a field of its own, a technical approach, a mindset, or just a passing hype that will be named differently in five years. We will see a bit more about the different perspectives and origins of what data science is or isn't. But I want to start with the common basis. What is data science in general? I would answer that data science is essentially **the art of gaining and communicating insights from complex data through digital techniques**.

Many quantitative scientists could also argue that they often do exactly this. They aim to learn new things about the world from data. And the use of digital tools is also clearly no longer a significant difference. However, this does not argue against a field called "Data Science," but rather only says that many quantitative scientists nowadays are also to some extent data scientists. They even have to be if they want to keep up with the state of the art in their fields, as many research areas are currently undergoing rapid change due to the widespread adoption of new digital techniques such as machine learning approaches.

Beyond the short definition of data science mentioned above, as already mentioned, there are numerous opinions on it. Often these also simply depend on the respective application area. Data science in consulting and business often means something different than data science in a more academic environment. However, in most cases, everyone can at least agree on a Venn diagram that is very often used in introductions in this - or slightly modified - form: Data science as the intersection of Digital Techniques (*digital tools/methods*), Statistics, and Domain Expertise.
