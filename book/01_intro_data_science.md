## What is Data Science?

Short answer, if we have to break it down to one sentence: **Data Science â‰ˆ "Gaining and communicating insights from complex data through digital techniques"**.

Unlike mathematics, physics, or history, data science has just begun to become a discipline of its own. If you ask 10 practicing data scientists what data science is, you might get very different answers. Worse still, there's not even a consensus on whether data science is a field of its own, a technical approach, a mindset, or just a passing hype that will be named differently in five years. We will see a bit more about the different perspectives and origins of what data science is or isn't. But I want to start with the common basis. What is data science in general? I would answer that data science is essentially **the art of gaining and communicating insights from complex data through digital techniques**.

Many quantitative scientists could also argue that they often do exactly this. They aim to learn new things about the world from data. And the use of digital tools is also clearly no longer a significant difference. However, this does not argue against a field called "Data Science," but rather only says that many quantitative scientists nowadays are also to some extent data scientists. They even have to be if they want to keep up with the state of the art in their fields, as many research areas are currently undergoing rapid change due to the widespread adoption of new digital techniques such as machine learning approaches.

Beyond the short definition of data science mentioned, opinions on what data science exactly is converge a bit. Frequently this simply depends on the respective application area. Data science in consulting and business often means something different than data science in a more academic environment. However, in most cases, everyone can at least agree on a Venn diagram that is very often used in introductions in this - or slightly modified - form: Data science as the intersection of Digital Techniques (*digital tools/methods*), Statistics, and Domain Expertise.

### Data is nothing new. So why now data science?

Data has been a cornerstone of human understanding for millennia - from  ancient civilizations keeping records of harvests and astronomy, to  modern businesses tracking sales and performance. It's clear that data  in itself is not a new concept. However, the emergence and ascendancy of data science as a discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. So, why now?

The prominence of data science in today's world can be attributed to several concurrent developments:

(1) The exponential **increase in the volume of data generated**. Thanks to digitalization and the rise of the Internet, mobile devices, and IoT (Internet of Things), we are producing data at a previously unimaginable scale. This big data presents both a challenge and an opportunity - the challenge being how to handle and process this vast amount of information, and the opportunity being the valuable insights that can be gleaned from it. 

This is accompanied by an increased recognition of the importance of data-driven decision-making across diverse sectors. Various industries, governments, and institutions have realized that leveraging the power of data can  lead to increased efficiency, better decision-making, and provide a competitive advantage. 

This existence (and appreciation) of larger and larger amounts of data can be seen as a substrate for the rise of data science, but it really needed a combination of several other developments to be able to properly work with such data.

(2) The evolution and expansion of **statistical methodologies** have been a key driver. Statistics provide the foundational principles and techniques  for analyzing data, making inferences, and predicting future trends. In the era of big data, classical and modern statistical techniques form the backbone of most analyses in data science. The relationship is actually so close, that in the 1990s statisticians like Jeff Wu even suggested renaming statistics to "Data Science" (despite all overlap, both terms still exist, and mean related but different things).

(3) The strides we've made in **data handling capabilities** have greatly facilitated the rise of data science. This obviously includes the drastic advancements in computational power and storage capabilities which made it possible to collect, store, and analyze these massive datasets. But this also includes many developments from computer science such as databases. Just a few decades ago, collecting, storing, and analyzing the vast  amounts of data we deal with today would have been unimaginable, let alone impractical.

(4) There has been significant progress in the field of **algorithms** including the field of machine learning, which are essential tools for understanding and interpreting data. These advancements have opened up new possibilities for predictive analytics, automation, and artificial intelligence.

(5) Lastly, the often-underestimated field of **data visualization** has seen revolutionary advancements. Effective data visualization makes complex data more comprehensible, accessible, and actionable. The development of powerful visualization tools enables us to present data in a visually  compelling manner that fosters understanding and drives informed decisions.

So, while data is not new, the volume of data, our ability to process it, and the recognition of its value, are. These changes have given rise to the burgeoning field of data science, marking a new era in our relationship with data.
