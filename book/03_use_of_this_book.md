# How to use this book (... if you ask us)

To start with the obvious: There is not one right way to use such a text book. But here we would like to give a few hints on how it is intended to be used. Plus, we will give some tips based on our experience in teaching Data Science.

- Go at your own pace. If things are to difficult, take the time to look for further material online (e.g. ...)
- No one becomes a data scientist from reading a book.
  You have to code yourself and work on actual data! Looking at code and saying "yeah, I got it" is **nowhere near** having mastered the same thing! Please believe us, this is the most common trap many students fall into. You only really learned the skills if you can apply them yourself, from scratch (not copy+paste and pressing run)!
- Chatbots are good data science assistants. But we firmly belief that you will only become a good data scientist if you learn how do solve things yourself. Getting the answer from a chatbot is no different from copying the solution of another student or from a forum. It might work and solve your exercises. But you won't learn much on the long run.
